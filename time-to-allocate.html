    <p>Giving Champions and Information Holders enough time to extract information, compile a response and get it approved is critical in ensuring a good compliance rate.
    </p>
    <p>When Information Holders are asked to answer requests with almost no time before the deadline is up the likelihood of the request being late increases.</p>
    <p>Information Holders usually have primary responsibilities that they can’t just drop when a nearly-late information request lands in their inbox. If the Information holder does manage to extract the information quickly, a negative approval means that there’s not enough time to make the required amends before the deadline passes.</p>
    <p>This situation puts considerable strain on the system. When the system is operating in such a way that everything is an emergency, it’s impossible to fast-track genuine emergency cases, and the staff involved become burned out and resentful of the service they are providing.
    </p>
    <p>The critical improvement to make in this situation is monitoring and improving <strong>Time-to-allocate</strong>.</p>
    <p>Time-to-allocate is the time taken between the information request being submitted by the Citizen and being assigned to the Information Holder <em>who can extract the required information</em>.</p>
    <p>Often Time-to-allocate is thought of as the initial allocation from the Central Team to the Service Champion of the appropriate Service Area. This is only half of the picture. Time-to-allocate includes the allocation of the request to the correct <em>Information Holder</em>.</p>
    <p>Time-to-allocate is largely ‘wasted’ time – time that could be used for a much calmer process of collating information and writing responses.</p>
