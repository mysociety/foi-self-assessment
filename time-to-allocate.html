        “We’re <em>more likely than not</em> to receive a request that’s <strong>already overdue</strong>, or very close to overdue.”
      </p>

    <p>Giving Champions and Information Holders enough time to extract information, compile a response and get it approved is critical in ensuring a good compliance rate.
    </p>
    <p>When Information Holders are asked to answer requests with almost no time before the deadline is up the likelihood of the request being late increases.</p>
    <p>Information Holders usually have primary responsibilities that they can’t just drop when a nearly-late information request lands in their inbox. If the Information holder does manage to extract the information quickly, a negative approval means that there’s not enough time to make the required amends before the deadline passes.</p>
    <p>This situation puts considerable strain on the system. When the system is operating in such a way that everything is an emergency, it’s impossible to fast-track genuine emergency cases, and the staff involved become burned out and resentful of the service they are providing.
    </p>
    <p>The critical improvement to make in this situation is monitoring and improving <strong>Time-to-allocate</strong>.</p>
    <p>Time-to-allocate is the time taken between the information request being submitted by the Citizen and being assigned to the Information Holder <em>who can extract the required information</em>.</p>
    <p>Often Time-to-allocate is thought of as the initial allocation from the Central Team to the Service Champion of the appropriate Service Area. This is only half of the picture. Time-to-allocate includes the allocation of the request to the correct <em>Information Holder</em>.</p>
    <p>Time to Allocate is largely “wasted” time – time that could be used for a much calmer process of collating information and writing responses.</p>

        “If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>So how do we measure and improve Time to Allocate? First, some definitions.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-small">Lead Time</h2>
    <p>Lead Time is the period between a new task’s appearance in your workflow and its final departure from the system.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-small">Cycle Time</h2>
    <p>Cycle Time begins at the moment when the new arrival enters “in progress” stage and somebody is actually working on it.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-small">Time to Allocate</h2>
    <p>Time to Allocate is the time the task takes to reach the correct person to work on it.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-medium">What to measure?</h2>
    <p>You can retrospectively measure Time-to-allocate if you have records of allocations.</p>
    <p>Initially we’d recommend sampling a selection of requests.</p>
    <p>For each request, take note of:</p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>The date the request was made by the Citizen</li>
      <li>The date the request was allocated to the Champion of the Service Area that was eventually responsible for answering the request</li>
      <li>The date the request was allocated to the Information Holder who extracted the information that answers the request.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should end up with a table that looks something like this:</p>
    <table class="add-margin-bottom">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Request ID</th>
          <th scope="col">Created At</th>
          <th scope="col">Allocated to SA</th>
          <th scope="col">Allocated to IH</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>FOI-123</td>
          <td>2018-03-27</td>
          <td>2018-03-27</td>
          <td>2018-03-28</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>FOI-456</td>
          <td>2018-03-27</td>
          <td>2018-03-28</td>
          <td>2018-04-04</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>FOI-789</td>
          <td>2018-04-02</td>
          <td>2018-04-07</td>
          <td>2018-04-07</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Highlight any “Allocated” columns where the date is greater than 2 days since the last:</p>
    <table class="add-margin-bottom">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Request ID</th>
          <th scope="col">Created At</th>
          <th scope="col">Allocated to SA</th>
          <th scope="col">Allocated to IH</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>FOI-123</td>
          <td>2018-03-27</td>
          <td>2018-03-27</td>
          <td>2018-03-28</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>FOI-456</td>
          <td>2018-03-27</td>
          <td>2018-03-28</td>
          <td><mark>2018-04-04</mark></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>FOI-789</td>
          <td>2018-04-02</td>
          <td><mark>2018-04-07</mark></td>
          <td>2018-04-07</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The highlighted cells illustrate where the actor received the request much later than they should have to give them enough time to act on the request. Occasional slow allocations may happen, but if you start seeing several you should dig in to it.</p>
    <p>For example, you may find that a particular Service Area always receives requests late. This may be due to the Central Team misunderstanding the information in a particular type of request and frequently initially sending it to a Service Area that sounds like they handle that time of information.</p>
    <p>Lots of late allocations to an Information Holder may be the sign of a Champion that needs additional training, or that the Champion’s area of responsibility is to wide.</p>
    <p>The best way to track Time-to-allocate is within your Case Management software itself.</p>
    <p>The MOJ Correspondence Tool requires users to “accept” an allocation, confirming that they can indeed provide information for the request.</p>
    <p>With this information, it could highlight requests where it hasn’t moved through the organisation in a timely manner.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-medium">How to Improve</h2>
    <p>Time to Allocate is an important thing to track and reduce for a few reasons:</p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>There’s <strong>less interaction with external systems</strong> so it's a fairly well defined problem</li>
      <li><strong>Software can help</strong> by recording metrics, learning and suggesting actions</li>
      <li><strong>Central Teams can make an impact</strong> as they have more control over this part of the system</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you can reliable monitor Time-to-Allocate, the first thing to do is set an SLA target.</p>
    <p>Ideally, there shouldn’t be more than 48 hours for each handoff, making a total target time of 96 hours (4 working days) between the Citizen submitting the request and it being allocated to an Information Holder who can definitely answer it.</p>
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Central Team to Champion Delays</h2>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>Too many Champions – not obvious which to pick, so it takes several attempts (all taking time) before it arrives at the correct Champion.</li>
      <li>Central Team don’t have a good enough understanding of information held by each Service Area. Build an information asset register and provide it to Central Team. Keep it updated. Ideally build it in to the software.</li>
      <li>Champions aren’t trained enough to know that sitting on a request causes overall problems. No consequences for doing this.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading-medium">Champion to Information Holder Delays</h2>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>Not enough Champions – they’re responsible for too broad an area and don’t have enough knowledge of all the information they may have access to.</li>
      <li>Information Holders aren’t trained enough to know that sitting on a request causes overall problems. No consequences for doing this.</li>
